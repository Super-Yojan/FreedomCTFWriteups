# Straw Hat Sailor

For this challenge I had to download the python file, there were few bitwise operators and some splicing. 

I start off by taking the last characters `ƴƴǀǠƘƘƼ` then I take the ord of the character then divide that by `-4` then take the `~` of that value finally you convert that number to characters. 

For ```ot`ib``` you take the ord of each characters then divide that by `-1` take the `~` of it and finally convert it to characters. 

For `vqdwg` take the ord of each character then `^` by 37 and convert it to chr to get the characters.
